Flow-Control describes the order in which the statements will be executed at runtime.

There are 3 types of flow-control statements,

1. Selection Statements: Among several options, only one option will be selected and executed.
    * if-else
    * switch-case

2. Iterative Statements: A group of statements will be executed iteratively.
    * while
    * do-while
    * for
    * for-each (v1.5)

3. Transfer Statements:
    * break
    * continue
    * return
    * try-catch-finally
    * assert (v1.4)



Selection Statements:
---------------------
* If-Else: The argument provided to the if statement should be of type boolean. By mistake, if we are trying to provide any other type, then we will get compile-time error. Also, the 'else' part and the curly braces are optional. Without curly braces, only one statement is allowed under the 'if' block, which should not be a declarative statement.

    The semicolon (;) is a valid Java statement, which is also known as the empty statement.

    There is no 'dangling else' problem in Java. Every 'else' block is mapped to the nearest 'if' block.
