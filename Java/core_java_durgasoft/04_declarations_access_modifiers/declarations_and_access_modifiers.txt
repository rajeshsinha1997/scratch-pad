Java Source File Structure:
---------------------------
* A Java program (Java source file) can contain any number of classes, but at most one class can be declared as 'public'. If there is a 'public' class, then the name of the program and the name of the 'public' class must be matched, otherwise we will get compile-time error.

    --> If there is no 'public' class available in a java program, then we can use any name for the Java program, and there are no restrictions.

    --> If a 'public' class is available in a Java program, then name of the Java program should be same as the name of the 'public' class, otherwise we will get compile-time error.

    --> If a Java program contains more than one 'public' class, then we will get compile-time error.

    --> Whenever we are compiling a Java program, for every class present in that program, a separate class file will be generated.

    --> We can compile a Java program, but we can run a Java class (.class file).

    --> Whenever we are executing a Java class, if the corresponding class file is not available, then we will get runtime exception 'NoClassDefFoundError'. Also, when we are executing a Java class, then the corresponding class's 'main()' method will be executed. If that class doesn't contain a 'main()' method, then we will get runtime exception 'NoSuchMethodError'.

    --> It is not recommended to declare multiple classes in a single Java source file. It is highly recommended to declare only one class per Java source file, and the name of the Java program should be same as the name of the class declared in that Java source file. The main advantage of this approach is readability and maintainability of the code will be improved.



* Types of Import Statements: There are two types of 'import' statements in Java,
    - explicit class import
    - implicit class import

    --> Explicit Class Import: It is highly recommended to use explicit class import, because it improves the readability of the code. Below is an example of explicit class import,
        - import <package_name>.<class_name>

    --> Implicit Class Import: It is not recommended to use implicit class import, because it reduces the readability of the code. Below is an example of implicit class import,
        - import <package_name>.*

* Whenever we are using fully qualified names, it is not required to write import statements. Similarly, whenever we are writing import statements, it is not recommended to use fully qualified names.

* While resolving class names, the Java compiler will always gives a precedence in the following order,
    - explicit class import
    - classes present in the current working directory (default package)
    - implicit class import

* Whenever we are importing a Java package, all classes and interfaces present in that package become available by default, but not the sub-package classes. If we want to use any class from the sub-package, compulsory we should write another import statement until sub-package level.

* All classes and interfaces present in the following packages are by default available to every Java program. Hence, we are not required to write import statement for these packages.
    - java.lang
    - default package (current working directory)

* Import statements are totally compile-time related concepts. If more number of imports are present, then the compile-time will increase in proportion, but there will be no effect on the execution time (runtime).

* Difference between #include (C language) and import statement (Java language): In the case of #include (C language) all of the input-output header files will be loaded at the beginning only (at translation time), hence it is 'static include'. But in the case of import statement (Java language), no class file will be loaded at the beginning. Whenever we are using a particular class, then only the corresponding class file will be loaded. This is considered as 'dynamic include' or 'load-on-demand' or 'load-on-fly'.

* New Features in v1.5 of Java: Below are some of the major features which were newly introduced in the v1.5 of Java,
    - for-each loop
    - var-arg methods
    - Auto-boxing and Auto-unboxing
    - Generics
    - co-verient return types
    - Queue
    - Annotations
    - Enums
    - static-import

* Static Import: Static import was a new concept which was introduced in v1.5 of Java. According to SUN, usage of static import reduces length of the code and improves readability. But, according to worldwide programming experts, usage of the static import creates confusion and reduces readability. Hence, if there is no specific requirement, then it is not recommended to use static import. Usually, we can access static members of a class by using that specific class name. But, whenever we are writing static import, we can access static members directly without class name.

* Explanation of 'System.out.println()': 'System' is a class present in 'java.lang' package. 'out' is a static variable present in the 'System' class of type 'PrintStream'. 'println()' is a method present in the 'PrintStream' class.

* While resolving static members, the Java compiler will always consider the precedence (priority) in the following order,
    - current class static members
    - explicit static imports
    - implicit static imports

* Two packages contains a class or interface with the same name is very rare in Java, and hence ambiguity problem is also very rare in case of normal import statements. But two classes or interfaces contains a variable or method with the same name is very common in Java, and hence ambiguity problem is also very common problem in case of static import statements.

* Difference between normal import and static import statements: We can use normal import statements to import classes and interfaces of a specific package in Java. Whenever we are using normal import statement, it is not required to use the fully qualified names, and we can use the corresponding short names directly. We can use the static import statements to import static members of a specific class or interface in Java. Whenever we are writing static import statements, it is not required to use the corresponding class or interface names to access the static members of that specific class or interface, and we can access them directly.

* Packages: It is an encapsulation mechanism in Java to group related classes and interfaces into a single unit, which is nothing but a package. As example, all classes and interfaces which are required for database operations, are grouped into a single package which is nothing but the 'java.sql' package. All classes and interfaces which are useful for File IO operations are grouped into a separate package which is nothing but the 'java.io' package.

* The main advantages of packages are,
    - To resolve naming conflicts, i.e. unique identification of our components.
    - It improves modularity of the application.
    - It improves maintainability of the application.
    - It provides security for our components.

* There is one universally accepted naming convention for packages, i.e. to use the internet domain name in reverse.
    Ex: 'com.citibank.loan.housing.Account'

* After compiling a Java program, if we want to place the generated class file/files to a specific location, we have to use the below command for compiling the Java program,

    - javac -d <location_to_place_generated_class_files> <java_program_name>.java

    As destination, we can take any valid directory name. But, if the specified directory or path not already available, then we will get compile-time error. Also at the time of execution, we have to use the fully qualified name for the corresponding Java program.

* In any Java source file, there can be at most one package statement, i.e. more than one package statement is not allowed, otherwise we will get compile-time error.

* In any Java program, the first non-comment statement should be a package statement (if it is available). Otherwise we will get compile-time error.

* An empty source file is also a valid Java program.
